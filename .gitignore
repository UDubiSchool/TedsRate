# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
#
# for help - obviously: man gitignore
#
#
# If the pattern ends with a slash, it is removed for a directory
# with the matching name and and all paths underneath it. However,
# NOT for files or links with the same name
